# 🚀 Project Overview: NextJS SaaS ShipFast

This project is a **developer boilerplate** designed to accelerate product development by providing a fully integrated and pre-configured tech stack. The goal is to eliminate the repetitive setup process and let developers start building actual features from day one.

## 💡 The Idea

Developers waste hours (or even days) configuring the same tools over and over. This project solves that by bundling together a modern, production-ready tech stack with all the plumbing already in place.

This template includes everything you need:

- Frontend and backend in **Next.js**
- **Convex** for database + backend logic
- **Clerk** for authentication and billing
- **Shadcn UI** + **Tailwind CSS** for UI
- Hosted on **Vercel**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Frontend + API | Next.js | Core framework for UI & routing |
| Backend Logic | Convex | Data layer + serverless functions |
| Auth & Billing | Clerk | User authentication and billing |
| UI Components | Shadcn UI | Pre-built accessible components |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling |
| Hosting | Vercel | Fast global deployment |

## 🎯 Objective

To create a **production-ready boilerplate** that helps developers:

- Save setup time
- Follow best practices
- Build and ship faster

The template should feel like a "Launchpad" – developers should clone it and immediately start adding business logic or UI features.

## 🤖 How the AI Should Help

You (the AI assistant) are expected to:

1. Understand the entire stack and its integrations.
2. Help troubleshoot integration issues between Convex, Clerk, and Next.js.
3. Recommend improvements or structure changes if best practices evolve.
4. Generate or modify code (pages, API routes, database schemas, UI components).
5. Keep the project modular, clean, and easy to customize.
6. Suggest features that developers might commonly want (e.g., dashboard, user profile, role management).
7. Assist with writing documentation, guides, or marketing content if needed.

## 📦 Planned Features (Optional, Iterative)

- Auth-protected routes out of the box
- Dynamic dashboard layout
- Ready-to-use Convex queries/mutations
- Pre-built UI components (login, register, settings)
- Billing page with Clerk integration
- Environment config via `.env.local`
- Mobile responsive design
